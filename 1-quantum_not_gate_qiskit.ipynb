    "In classical programming, a [NOT gate](https://bit.ly/2SmqonO) turns a 0 bit into a 1 bit, and vice-versa. The quantum version of a NOT gate is the X gate, often referred to as the [Pauli-X gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate#Pauli-X_gate). It turns a [qubit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit) symbolized in a [Dirac notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bra%E2%80%93ket_notation \"Dirac notation article on Wikipedia\") _ket_ by $\\vert0\\rangle$ into a $\\vert1\\rangle$, and vice-versa. These $\\vert0\\rangle$ and $\\vert1\\rangle$ qubits are quantum states, specifically $computational$ $basis$ $states$, and they are the quantum counterparts of the classical 0 and 1 bits. The X gate also operates on quantum states that are in some combination, or *superposition*, of the $\\vert0\\rangle$and $\\vert1\\rangle$ computational basis states. To demonstrate the X gate, we'll create a simple quantum circuit with the [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) framework after we've imported the necessary items.\n",

The sphere on the left represents a $\\vert0\\rangle$ qubit, as the line & arrow points to the top of the sphere. Similarly, the sphere on the right represents a $\\vert1\\rangle$ qubit, with the line & arrow pointing to the bottom of the sphere.\n",

    "#### Behavior of quantum gates on the Bloch sphere\n",
    "Each quantum gate, including the X gate, transforms a quantum state to a (usually) different one. The behavior of these transformations on a Bloch sphere is that the line & arrow rotates to another point on the surface. Specifically, the X gate rotates $\\pi$ radians ($180$ degrees) around the X axis. For example, the Bloch sphere on the left results in the Bloch sphere on the right, and vice-versa.\n",

    "To get a better feel for how Bloch spheres represent qubits and the behavior of quantum gates, go ahead and experiment with this [Bloch sphere playground application](https://javafxpert.github.io/grok-bloch \"grok-bloch application\"). Use the buttons labeled *$\\vert0\\rangle$*, *$\\vert1\\rangle$*, and *X* and notice how the line & arrow are positioned after each click. There are several other gates on the right side of the application with which you can experiment, even if you aren't yet familiar with them. Playing around will give you some intuition about their behavior in advance of when you study them more formally. \n",
